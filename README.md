<h2 align="center">About</h2>
<p>In this repository, I will implement and explain some data structures so that by the end of it, we will have a clear notion of how and when to use each of the structures that are often neglected by programmers.<p>
<br>

<h2 align="center">Form of approach</h2>
<p>A problem will be chosen, and after the choice, we will solve it using some data structure as part of the strategy. It is important to say that the strategy will not necessarily be the best for a given problem, because the focus is to present the behavior of the respective structure in a didactic way.</p>
